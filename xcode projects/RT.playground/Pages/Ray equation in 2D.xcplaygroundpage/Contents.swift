 ## Get started with Ray Tracing in cross section
 For most math problems, 2D are always a good starting point. Let's look at how ray intersect with object in 2D. We can start by taking a cross section with 3D situation that contains camera and viewing direction.
 */
/*:
 - Note:
 **Image Line**
 \
 By taking a cross section, you can consider the screen as Image Line, which is a line (As üèû shows in live view). The Image Line shows objects behind it (which is LineAB on live view).
 \
 \
 **Line Segment**
 \
 To make the scene simpler, there's only a line connecting Point A and Point B (As you see on live view). You can consider the Line Segment as scene object.
 \
 \
 **Camera**
 \
 To make it even simpler, we put our Camera on C(0, 0), which is the origin of the 2D coordinate system (As üì∑ shows in live view).
 \
 \
 **Ray**
 \
 We pick a Point P on Image Line denotes the pixel we want to show on screen, connecting P and C gives us the viewing direction. Which is the direction of ray. And we can build the Ray from C through P until often to Line Segment. Yes, the red line is our Ray. As I discussed on first page, ray tracing is about a mathematical way to compute the intersection point with the scene. Which is Point I on the scene.

 - Important:
 Mathematical Way
 \
 \
 **Implicit Line Equation**
 \
 You may know a Line Equation can be expressed as *y = k‚Ä¢x+b*, or *a‚Ä¢x + b‚Ä¢y +c  = 0* in Implicit way. In order not to get into the trouble of k=0, we choose the Implicit Line Equation.
 \
 Of course we can calculate a b c by substituting the coordinates of A(x1,y1) and B(x2,y2).
 \
 Which gives us *a = y1 - y2*, *b = x2 - x1* and *c = x1‚Ä¢y2 - x2‚Ä¢y1* in *a‚Ä¢x + b‚Ä¢y +‚Ä¢c  = 0*.
 \
 \
 **Ray Parametric Function**
 \
 You may say Ray Equation can also be expressed as implicit line equation, but we may get into the trouble in 3D, so we gonna use Parametric Function.
 \
 *R(t) = (1-t)‚Ä¢C + t‚Ä¢P*, where t is the weight averaged of C and P, which means R(t) goes through C and P. And we can also relabel C and P with R(0) and R(1) as the two equations tell us below.
 \
 *R(0) = C, t = 0*
 \
 *R(1) = P, t = 1*
 \
 \
 **Intersection**
 \
 As I saied before, we called our Intersection Point I with coordinate of I(Ix,Iy). So there must be some value of t go through I that I = R(t*)
 \
 This actually two equations. Ix = Rx(t*) and Iy = Ry(t*)
 \
 Ix = (1-t*)‚Ä¢Cx + t‚Ä¢Px 1‚É£Ô∏è
 \
 Iy = (1-t*)‚Ä¢Cy + t‚Ä¢Py 2‚É£Ô∏è
 \
 And I is also on line segment AB, so *a‚Ä¢Ix + b‚Ä¢Iy +c  = 0* 3‚É£Ô∏è
 \
 Simultaneous equations 1‚É£Ô∏è2‚É£Ô∏è3‚É£Ô∏è gives us t* and Coordinate of I(Ix,Iy).

 - Experiment:
 ‚Ä¢ Silde the red Point P on image view from top to bottom, see the image forming up on it.
 \
 ‚Ä¢ Change the positions of  A and B, the silde agian.
 \
 ‚Ä¢ Watch the parameters on screen and understand mathematical formulas behind 2D Ray Tracing
